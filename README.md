SENSEI CITY RUNNER APP

30-01-2014

Monday Feb 3, 2000 students participated in the 'Students in motion' week. Students do assignments for the city of Amsterdam. One of the assignments is exercising with the SIM SENSEI City Runner app.

The SIM SENSEI City Runner app encourages running in the city and also contributes to the scientific research of the HvA. People who turn on the City Runner app, generate motion data which is used to determine how people are running and how they feel about it. 

The City Runner app is developed especially for SIM by the COMMIT project SENSEI, Amsterdam Creative Industries Centre of Expertise project Sense in the City and the CitySDK project which are three projects of the research group Digital Life.
